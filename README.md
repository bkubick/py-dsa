# Python Data Structures & Algorithms (py-dsa)

## Description

This repo digs into fundamental data structures and algorithms. The purpose of doing this is it get practice and review common data structures and algorithms used in computer science.

In addition to practice/review, I want a centralized location that I can implement in personal projects.

This is a repository that is actively being developed. See below for the planned upcoming work.

1. Add `Trie` data structure class.
2. Add `Queue` data structure class.
3. Add `MinHeap` data structure class.
4. Add `MaxHeap` data structure class.
5. Add `DoublyLinkedList` data structure class.
6. Add unit tests.
