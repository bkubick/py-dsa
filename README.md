# Python Data Structures & Algorithms (py-dsa)

## Description

This repo digs into fundamental data structures and algorithms. The purpose of doing this is it get practice and review common data structures and algorithms used in computer science.

In addition to practice/review, I want a centralized location that I can implement in personal projects.

## Documentation

### Data Structures

There are a handful of custom classes of common Data Structures I have implemented. The list of currently implemented data structures are listed below.

* `BinaryTree`
* `SinglyLinkedList`

### Algorithms

There are a handful of custom implementations of common algorithms. The list of currently implemented algorithms are listed below.

#### Search
* `binary_search`

#### Sorting
* `bubble_sort`
* `insertion_sort`
* `mergesort`
* `quicksort`
* `selection_sort`

## Upcoming Work

This is a repository that is actively being developed. See below for the planned upcoming work.

1. Add `Trie` data structure class.
2. Add `Queue` data structure class.
3. Add `MinHeap` data structure class.
4. Add `MaxHeap` data structure class.
5. Add `DoublyLinkedList` data structure class.
6. Add unit tests.
